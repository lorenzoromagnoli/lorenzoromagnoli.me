### How does it feel to be an object in a smart home?

As things become smarter and connected, their roles in people’s lives are challenged. Things become closer and closer to us, eventually becoming “users” themselves. How will we understand objects’ needs and perspectives and potentially design for them?

While designers and companies that deal with smartness and artificial intelligence try merge the gap between human and objects by designing objects and machines that resemble more humans in their form and interaction, we decided to take the opposite approach and create an experience for ‘humans’ to get closer to feeling and acting like objects.

For the latest version of the experience we asked [Bruce Sterling](https://www.wired.com/category/beyond_the_beyond/) to work with us and expand the piece with some housolds objects stories. Many thanks to Bruce, [Jasmina Tesanovic](https://jasminatesanovic.wordpress.com/) and [Regine Debatty](http://we-make-money-not-art.com/) who were so kind to borrow our objects their voices.
