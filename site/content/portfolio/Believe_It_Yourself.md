The fast spreading and ease of access to Machine Learning and Cloud computing has brought to a boom of experiments and excitement around our ability to build machines that make sense, learn, measure and predict the world around us.

Moreover, with enough examples, we can train a tool or a 'machine' to recognize or quantify pretty much anything we want. 'Beauty', 'Hotdog-ness' or the more problematic 'Criminal-ness' and 'Sexual orientation' can be now measured within a few frames, based on a model, a probability, determined by a set of arbitrarily collected data. Subjective judgments and biased datasets can easily be turned into objective measures and potential truths, which will then be embedded in devices around us.

But what if we would train machines to measure even more unmeasurable, personal and culturally driven things? If we gather enough samples could we detect signs that prove and detect our superstitions? and can we use that to build tools and devices that reflect our own beliefs?

BIY™- Believe it Yourself is a series of real-fictional belief-based computing kits to make and tinker with vernacular logics and superstitions.

We worked with experts in fortune telling from Italy, geomancy from China  and numerology from India to translate their knowledge and beliefs into 0100110010. With BIY™ you can tinker with cameras that can see luck, microphones that interpret your destiny, and compasses that can point you to harmony and balance.

As we tend to believe what machines say without often questioning them, now we can at least make machines that believe what we might believe in.

- **OBJECT RECOGNITION TO SMORFIA:** The camera interprets what it sees according to the “smorfia” a book that details the old Neapolitan tradition in which dreams are analyzed and converted into numbers.
- **BAD LUCK ALERT:** The board uses a camera  to interpret its surrounding and inform the user of very unlucky configurations (e.g. a black cat crossing the street - 13 people sitting at a dinner table, or a person opening an umbrella indoor).
- **FACE 2 ‘JETTATORE:’**Our Facial recognition is trained on specific facial physiognomies of people that normally bring bad luck (known as Jettatore)

- **GENERATIVE PROPHECIES:** The board generates prophecies based on the lucky and destiny numbers that can be heard from its speaker or also printed out with our Destiny printer extension kit.
- **DESTINY CLOCK:** The board interprets the date and time in which is turned on to constantly determine a Lucky numbers and Destiny number for the board itself, that can be used for your projects.
